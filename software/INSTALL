The recommended way to build xwax is to run "make" with your chosen
compile options, followed optionally by "make install" to install at
the given prefix; eg.

  $ make PREFIX=/root ALSA=yes
  
Add the compiled "xwax" executable to the root of your USB drive. A 
stock SC1000 already lets you overwrite the internal copy of xwax with one on the USB drive.
For compilation, use an arm-linux-uclibcgnueabihf-gcc compiler. I'd recommend 
setting up buildroot to do this, which should have a mostly preconfigured .config 
file for the Olimex A13-SOM-256 board or the Allwinner A13 ARM Cortex A8 SoC processor. 
Important things for compilation are to ensure you're using uClibc as your C library, 
you have shared and static linking enabled (Not either or alone), 
and you've enabled the alsa-lib sound library.

Don't forget to edit the Makefile so it uses the correct compiler.

If PREFIX is not given, the user's home directory is used and "make
install" does not need to be run as root. This will cause the sound libraries to not
be found by the program when executed so don't forget this.

Different audio device types are enabled using the compile options:

  ALSA=yes
  JACK=yes
  OSS=yes

If you are doing multiple builds you may like to put the compile
options in a file named '.config' in the source directory instead of
on the command line. There is a script to generate this file; for more
information run

  $ ./configure --help

Compilation errors are most likely the result of missing
libraries. You need the libraries and header files installed for:

* libSDL: http://www.libsdl.org/
* SDL_ttf (sometimes part of the SDL package, sometimes not)

Optional dependencies are:

* libasound: http://www.alsa-project.org/ (for ALSA=yes)
* JACK: http://jackaudio.org/ (for JACK=yes)

These libraries are packaged with most Linux distributions and this is
the recommended way to install them.
